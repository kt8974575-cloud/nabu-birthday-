const text = `My dearest wife, Nancy 💖  

There are so many words in the world, but none are enough to express how deeply I love you. From the moment you came into my life, everything became brighter, softer, and more meaningful. You turned my ordinary world into something beautiful — a place filled with warmth, laughter, and endless love.  

You are my heart, my peace, my everything. Every heartbeat I have beats for you, every breath I take carries your name. You are not just the love of my life, Nancy — you are my life itself.  

On your birthday, I just want to remind you how precious you are to me. You are my best friend, my soulmate, my wife, and the most wonderful gift I’ve ever received. Your smile lights up my darkest days, and your love gives me strength I never knew I had.  

Happy Birthday, my love. I promise to stand by your side through every storm and every sunshine. I will love you in every moment, in every lifetime, and beyond forever.  

You are my dream come true, the reason behind every smile I wear. I’m grateful for you every single day, Nancy — my heart belongs to you
